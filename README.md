#### Ross' Enticing MySQL Interface

The thing is... there are NO (read: no) good MySQL interfaces that work on Linux.  The "best" two are MySQL Workbench (which is archaic, horribly made, and extremely bloated) and Emma (which has not been worked on since 2006, and feels... dangerous (I have done bad things several times because it doesn't try to scare you out of it) and buggy (try adding a new table... nope!)).  There are some decent web apps:  SQLBuddy (which is good for simple things, but everything else sucks) and PHPMyAdmin (which only connects to local databases).

Have no fear, this node.js app--built on the [Cornerstone](https://github.com/connectai/node-framework) framework--aims to fill that gap.
